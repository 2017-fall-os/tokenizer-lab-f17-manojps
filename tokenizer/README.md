Run "make" to build the executable. Use "make demo" or "./test" to run the test program.

The Tester calls mytoc(char **str, char delim) to tokenize some predefined inputs. Once the predefined test cases were executed, the tester shows a user prompt through which users can tokenize their own inputs.

Type "exit" in the command prompt to exit the program.

Implementation Notes:
I have used arrays and pointers to manipulate tokenizer inputs.
C functions - malloc() and free() - was used for memory management.
A simple Makefile was written for separate compilation and linking.
